# PrestaShop Icon Pack

As part of PrestaShop's product redesign, we decided to use and create our own icon pack. We're sharing here the very first version of this new icon set.

This icon pack is in Beta version: it's a work in progress!

It's also released under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). You can do pretty much what you want with it, except reselling it!

So feel free to use this set, play with it, customize it. Show us what you did with it!
We'd be also really pleased to be credited in your about page, or wherever you use the pack. Thanks in advance! :)
